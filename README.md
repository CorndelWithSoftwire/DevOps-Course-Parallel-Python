# Introduction

Welcome to Python!

Python is designed to be comparatively easy to pick up but even so, learning a programming language can be difficult. Compared to the course material in Aptem, this mini course is focused on:

- Explaining new topics in greater detail and compared to familiar concepts.
- More examples for each topic.
- Practical exercises to build a deeper understanding and improve muscle memory.

The aim is to make Python more approachable for everyone, even those without any programming experience.

After this course you should feel confident using Python and have a solid understanding of its core concepts. The material available in Aptem will provide more detail in some areas, and some longer exercises, but here we will master the basics.
